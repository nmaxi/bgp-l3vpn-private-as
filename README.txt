MPLS L3VPN
PE-CE: BGP (Dual-Homed)
Only one customer but different configs:
• allowas-in
• as-override
• remove-private-as
• different AS-Number
Using SoO on every site's PE because of Dual-Homed design
Images: Cisco IOL 15.7(3)M2
6 PE-Routers (two of them are also Route-Reflectors) (SP-R1, SP-R6)
12 CE-Routers
It took me 3 hours to complete this lab
